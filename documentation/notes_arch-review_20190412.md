## What data should our site collect on the users? General opinions on user-centricity? Thoughts? 
do not require login, but have it as an option -> prioritize as little data as possible
it would be really helpful to see all the other events I'm booked for
  but logging in could be really tedious / annoying
email only
email and name
phone number if you want to send text reminders?
logging in with google or facebook would be really helpful
